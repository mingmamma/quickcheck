// All the properties define in this trait are created from forAll method in the Prop companion object, which is the most common way to
// define a property (represented by Prop class) that is universally qunatified. The main shape of the parameter list of all overloaded forAll variants
// takes a function as parameter. This function's parameters can be of any type as long as random value can be generated for that type.
// A handy way to supply a random value generator is via the mechanism of implicit parameter and such random value
// generators are represented by Arbitrary or Gen class. The functions return type is boolean s.t. the gist of forAll can be understood as the boolean condition,
// "the property", should hold true for all values of the given parameters
